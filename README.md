# ImageCaptioning
ImageCaptioning using inception_resnet_v2

The main idea behind this research is to try improving the Image captioning results, the change that I made is using BERT token embeddings for the text (captions)  and I used Inception_resnet_v2 for the images and I successfully implemented them. Also, It is proposed to use BERTScore[2] for captions evaluation, but this is not included in the implementation.

Dataset: 
I downloaded it using torrent because it's quite big and the provided forum for downloading it is not working.
